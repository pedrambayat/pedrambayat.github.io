Hi! I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Bioengineering and Systems Engineering.

I'm interested in using computation to better understand how biological systems interact and evolve. My research goal is to enhance the design and understanding of biological systems to approach unanswered questions in human health. I'm broadly curious about generative molecular design, agent-assisted biomedical research, perturbation modeling, and maintaining a second brain to think about all of this via the Zettelkasten method.

I currently spend my time researching ML guided protein binder design at Penn Medicine's [Center for Cellular Immunotherapies](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cci/) and investigating solutions to antimicrobial resistance at [Chloropept](https://www.chloropept.bio/). Previously, I spent time at Arc Institute working on single cell RNA sequencing, Genentech working on assay development for novel CAR-Ts, and Stanford learning how to purify proteins.

I'm always open to chat. Feel free to reach me via email, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrambayat/), or [X](https://x.com/bayat_Pedram).
