Hi, I'm Pedram, a third-year student at the University of Pennsylvania studying bioengineering. I'm interested in using computational and experimental approaches to better understand how biological systems interact and evolve. I strongly believe that the blend between machine learning and biology can provide a novel approach to many questions left unanswered in human health. My research goal is to build computational and wet-lab tools to enhance the design and understanding of biological systems.

For the past few years, I have had the opportunity to explore my interest through various research and project experiences. My journey started in 2023, where I spent a summer learning how to purify proteins in Roger Kornberg's lab at Stanford. I later joined Marco Ruella's lab at Penn, where I have been investigating mechanisms of relapse to CAR-T cell therapy since. I did a brief stint at Hani Goodarzi's lab at Arc Institute, working on single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. Most recently, I have been completing an internship in Genentech's drug discovery department. 

Through this website, I invite you to learn more about me and the work that I have done. Please feel free to reach out to me at my [email](mailto:pbayat@seas.upenn.edu) or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrambayat/).
