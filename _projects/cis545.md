### Project Overview

The goal of this project was to gain insight on the relationship between a song's audio features and its genre. Specifically, we were interested in which audio features are most import in distinguishing between different genres, beyond what comes naturally to the ear.

To do this, we implemented a few machine learning models (random forest, XGBoost, neural netowrk) to compare their performance in classifying songs into one of six genre categories. Then, we used hypothesis testing to evaluate patterns we observed in the data. Check out the project notebook [here](https://github.com/pedrambayat/genre-classification).

My contributions wer in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and tuning the random forest and XGBoost models.
