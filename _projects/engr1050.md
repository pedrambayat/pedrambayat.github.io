### Project Overview & Motivation

This project analyzes cell morphology and movement over time using microscopy images and computer vision techniques. By segmenting cells, extracting contours, and tracking changes in shape, area, and brightness, I quantitatively assessed differences in cell behavior across experimental conditions. This workflow automates what would otherwise be manual, time-consuming image analysis. Check out the project notebook [here](https://github.com/pedrambayat/cell-movement-morphology).

### Methods

- **Image preprocessing**: Converting `.tif` images to grayscale and applying thresholding to segment cells from background noise.
- **Feature extraction (OpenCV)**: Drawing contours, measuring changes in cell area & brightness intensity, and calculating cell centroids.
- **Movement analysis**: Tracking centroid displacement over time and measuring relative changes in area and brightness between time points.
- **Automation**: Implemented batch analysis for multiple cell images across two cell types, exported results to Excel for downstream analysis, and implemented unit tests for validation.

### Results

Successfully quantified cell velocity across time-lapse images and morphological changes in area and brightness.
